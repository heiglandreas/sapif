# Show before post IF

A plugin that allows to show content before a post depending on it's position in
"The Loop"

You ever wanted to display something before the second post on your blog? Here's
the answer!

Set the 'equation'-value to 'x', the expected values to '2' and add your content.

Or you might want to show something before every odd post? Set 'equation' to 'x % 2'
and your expected  value to '1'.
